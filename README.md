# SpaceInvaders

This is a C snippet for a space invaders game written for a Texas Instruments tm4c1234 microcontroller with several breadboard controller peripherals and a LCD screen. I used structs to represent the player and enemy sprite status, providing a rudementary object-oriented interface to write the main logic. I created custom sprites, giving the game a college theme, but this file is not included.
